## Preface

This repository contains Helm charts and Docker builds for global 
components of AI Singapore's end-to-end ML projects.

This repository is to setup the following by the MLOps team within the 
K8S clusters created by the DataOps and InfraOps teams:

- MLFlow
- VSCode

This has to be installed after the cluster is set up with its 
persistence storage and an orchestrator of choice (RunAI, Polyaxon, 
etc.).
